    name: "The Strange Library",
    content:"An Innocent Quest for Knowledge Leads to Unsettling Discoveries | Chapter 1A young boy, the protagonist of Haruki Murakami's The Strange Library,embarks on what seems like an innocuous quest for knowledge when he decides to visit his local library. His objective is simple yet peculiar for someone his age: he wants to learn about tax collection in the Ottoman Empire. As he steps into the library, an unexpected journey begins, punctuated by an eerie and unsettling atmosphere.The library, initially a mundane and familiar place, soon takes on a mysterious vibe as the boy walks through its doors. He approaches the librarian, a somewhat stern and unyielding figure, and requests books on his desired subject. The librarian, instead of directly helping the boy, directs him to room 107, a place he has never heard of before. The boy, with a mix of curiosity and obedience, follows the guidance, descending into the bowels of the library.Room 107 is unlike any other part of the library — dark and cavernous, it exudes a sense of foreboding. Here, the ambiance shifts dramatically, and the boy's journey begins to take on an almost nightmarish quality. As he navigates this peculiar space, he meets the old man, a grim and somewhat sinister figure who leads him further into the depths of the library. The boy soon realizes that this isn’t just a simple room; it’s an entrance to a maze-like underground world.Adding to the surreal nature of his predicament, the boy encounters another enigmatic figure known as the sheep man. This character, half-human, half-sheep, further enforces the boy’s sense of being trapped in an otherworldly dimension. As he converses with the sheep man and the old man, the boy comprehends the gravity of his situation: he is imprisoned by this uncanny duo, compelled to read and absorb knowledge but without any hope of leaving this labyrinthine library.Thus, the boy's innocent quest for knowledge morphs into a chilling exploration of confinement and the unknown. Each new discovery and interaction draws him further away from the safety and normalcy of the world he knows, enveloping him deeper into the strange, dream-like reality of the library. This initial foray sets the stage for a narrative that is rich in allegory, filled with layers of meaning and questioning the very essence of knowledge, freedom, and reality.",

    name: "Norwegian Wood",
    content:"As his plane arrives at Hamburg Airport, Toru Watanabe hears the Beatles' song Norwegian Wood played over the speakers, bringing back an intense and painful memory, a scene from 18 years ago in 1969 when he was 19 years old. As he walks through a large empty meadow with Naoko, a girl he loved, she tells him a story about a mysterious well hidden in the grasses into which people had occasionally fallen into and died in. Naoko says that she isn't afraid that Toru would fall in and knows that she too would be safe so long as she stayed with him; they share this intimacy, but when Toru suggests to Naoko that she relax herself, Naoko is hurt and explains that she can't relax because she is doing all she can to not fall apart. However, as the two walk into a forest they reconcile and Naoko asks two wishes of Toru: that he know how much she appreciates his coming to visit her, and that he remember her. Toru earnestly promises at the time, but then later remarks on how the passing of time made his memory fade of her—though it also allowed him to write about her.",

    name: "What i talk about When I Talk about running",
    content:"Murakami writes For me, running is both exercise and a metaphor. Throughout the book, he writes of how running informs his creative life.He recalls his inspiration to become a novelist, which occurred while watching a baseball game: The crack of bat meeting ball right on the sweet spot echoed through the stadium. Hilton easily rounded first and pulled up to second. And it was at that exact moment that a thought struck me: You know what? I could try writing a novel. I still can remember the wide open sky, the feel of the new grass, the satisfying crack of the bat. Something flew down from the sky at that instant, and, whatever it was, I accepted it. Before that, he had owned a jazz club, which he sold after his first two novels were published.Most people I knew where flat out against my decision, or else had grave doubts about it. 'Your business is doing fine now' they said. 'Why not just let someone else run it for a time while you go and write your novels?' From the world's viewpoint this makes perfect sense. And most people probably didn't think I'd make it as a professional writer. But I couldn't follow their advice. I'm the kind of person who has to totally commit to whatever I do.After that, he started running long distances to stay healthy. He found success with the novels A Wild Sheep Chase and Norwegian Wood.Much of the book describes his training for the New York City Marathon; he describes running from Athens to Marathon, Greece, an ultramarathon in Hokkaido and a triathlon in Murakami, Niigata Prefecture. He writes of translating F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby and the complete works of Raymond Carver into Japanese. He writes that Most of what I know about writing I've learned through running every day",

    name: "Hear the wind sing",
    content:"Hear the Wind Sing (風の歌を聴け, Kaze no uta o kike) is the first novel by Japanese writer Haruki Murakami. It first appeared in the June 1979 issue of Gunzo, and in book form the next month. The novel was adapted by Japanese director Kazuki Ōmori in a 1981 film distributed by Art Theatre Guild. An English translation by Alfred Birnbaum appeared in 1987.It is the first book in the so-called Trilogy of the Rat series of independent novels, followed by Pinball, 1973 (1980) and A Wild Sheep Chase (1982), before the later epilogue Dance Dance Dance (1988). All four books in the series have been translated into English, but Hear the Wind Sing and Pinball, 1973 (which are realist novels slightly differing from the author's later style) were never widely distributed in the English-speaking world, having only been published in Japan by Kodansha under their Kodansha English Library branding (for English Foreign Language learners), and both only as A6-sized pocketbooks. This was due to Murakami viewing the two novels as works from his immature period.[1] An omnibus English edition of Murakami's first two novels (Hear the Wind Sing and Pinball, 1973), under the title Wind/Pinball, with translations by Prof. Ted Goossen of York University, was released in the United States in August, 2015.",

    name: "After the Quake",
    content:"The stories were written in response to Japan's 1995 Kobe earthquake, and each story is affected peripherally by the disaster. Along with Underground, a collection of interviews and essays about the 1995 Tokyo gas attacks, and The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, a complex exploration of Japan's modern history, after the quake represents part of an effort on the part of Murakami to adopt a more purposeful exploration of the Japanese national conscience.The stories in after the quake repeat motifs, themes, and elements common in much of Murakami's earlier short stories and novels, but also present some notable stylistic changes. All six stories are told in the third person, as opposed to Murakami's much more familiar first person narrative established in his previous work. Additionally, only one of the stories contains clear supernatural elements, which are present in the majority of Murakami's stories. All of the stories are set in February 1995, the month between the Kobe earthquake and the Tokyo gas attacks. Translator Jay Rubin says of the collection, The central characters in after the quake live far from the physical devastation, which they witness only on TV or in the papers, but for each of them the massive destruction unleashed by the earth itself becomes a turning point in their lives. They are forced to confront an emptiness they have borne inside them for years",
